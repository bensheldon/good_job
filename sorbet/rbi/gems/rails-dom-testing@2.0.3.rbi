# Adds the +assert_select+ method for use in Rails functional
# test cases, which can be used to make assertions on the response HTML of a controller
# action. You can also call +assert_select+ within another +assert_select+ to
# make assertions on elements selected by the enclosing assertion.
#
# Use +css_select+ to select elements without making an assertions, either
# from the response HTML or elements selected by the enclosing assertion.
#
# In addition to HTML responses, you can make the following assertions:
#
# * +assert_select_encoded+ - Assertions on HTML encoded inside XML, for example for dealing with feed item descriptions.
# * +assert_select_email+ - Assertions on the HTML body of an e-mail.
module Rails::Dom::Testing::Assertions::SelectorAssertions
  include ::Rails::Dom::Testing::Assertions::SelectorAssertions::CountDescribable

  # An assertion that selects elements and makes one or more equality tests.
  #
  # If the first argument is an element, selects all matching elements
  # starting from (and including) that element and all its children in
  # depth-first order.
  #
  # If no element is specified +assert_select+ selects from
  # the element returned in +document_root_element+
  # unless +assert_select+ is called from within an +assert_select+ block.
  # Override +document_root_element+ to tell +assert_select+ what to select from.
  # The default implementation raises an exception explaining this.
  #
  # When called with a block +assert_select+ passes an array of selected elements
  # to the block. Calling +assert_select+ from the block, with no element specified,
  # runs the assertion on the complete set of elements selected by the enclosing assertion.
  # Alternatively the array may be iterated through so that +assert_select+ can be called
  # separately for each element.
  #
  #
  # ==== Example
  # If the response contains two ordered lists, each with four list elements then:
  #   assert_select "ol" do |elements|
  #     elements.each do |element|
  #       assert_select element, "li", 4
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # will pass, as will:
  #   assert_select "ol" do
  #     assert_select "li", 8
  #   end
  #
  # The selector may be a CSS selector expression (String) or an expression
  # with substitution values (Array).
  # Substitution uses a custom pseudo class match. Pass in whatever attribute you want to match (enclosed in quotes) and a ? for the substitution.
  # assert_select returns nil if called with an invalid css selector.
  #
  # assert_select "div:match('id', ?)", /\d+/
  #
  # === Equality Tests
  #
  # The equality test may be one of the following:
  # * <tt>true</tt> - Assertion is true if at least one element selected.
  # * <tt>false</tt> - Assertion is true if no element selected.
  # * <tt>String/Regexp</tt> - Assertion is true if the text value of at least
  #   one element matches the string or regular expression.
  # * <tt>Integer</tt> - Assertion is true if exactly that number of
  #   elements are selected.
  # * <tt>Range</tt> - Assertion is true if the number of selected
  #   elements fit the range.
  # If no equality test specified, the assertion is true if at least one
  # element selected.
  #
  # To perform more than one equality tests, use a hash with the following keys:
  # * <tt>:text</tt> - Narrow the selection to elements that have this text
  #   value (string or regexp).
  # * <tt>:html</tt> - Narrow the selection to elements that have this HTML
  #   content (string or regexp).
  # * <tt>:count</tt> - Assertion is true if the number of selected elements
  #   is equal to this value.
  # * <tt>:minimum</tt> - Assertion is true if the number of selected
  #   elements is at least this value.
  # * <tt>:maximum</tt> - Assertion is true if the number of selected
  #   elements is at most this value.
  #
  # If the method is called with a block, once all equality tests are
  # evaluated the block is called with an array of all matched elements.
  #
  #   # At least one form element
  #   assert_select "form"
  #
  #   # Form element includes four input fields
  #   assert_select "form input", 4
  #
  #   # Page title is "Welcome"
  #   assert_select "title", "Welcome"
  #
  #   # Page title is "Welcome" and there is only one title element
  #   assert_select "title", {count: 1, text: "Welcome"},
  #       "Wrong title or more than one title element"
  #
  #   # Page contains no forms
  #   assert_select "form", false, "This page must contain no forms"
  #
  #   # Test the content and style
  #   assert_select "body div.header ul.menu"
  #
  #   # Use substitution values
  #   assert_select "ol>li:match('id', ?)", /item-\d+/
  #
  #   # All input fields in the form have a name
  #   assert_select "form input" do
  #     assert_select ":match('name', ?)", /.+/  # Not empty
  #   end

  # Extracts the content of an element, treats it as encoded HTML and runs
  # nested assertion on it.
  #
  # You typically call this method within another assertion to operate on
  # all currently selected elements. You can also pass an element or array
  # of elements.
  #
  # The content of each element is un-encoded, and wrapped in the root
  # element +encoded+. It then calls the block with all un-encoded elements.
