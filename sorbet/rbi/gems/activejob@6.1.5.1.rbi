# = Active Job
#
# Active Job objects can be configured to work with different backend
# queuing frameworks. To specify a queue adapter to use:
#
#   ActiveJob::Base.queue_adapter = :inline
#
# A list of supported adapters can be found in QueueAdapters.
#
# Active Job objects can be defined by creating a class that inherits
# from the ActiveJob::Base class. The only necessary method to
# implement is the "perform" method.
#
# To define an Active Job object:
#
#   class ProcessPhotoJob < ActiveJob::Base
#     def perform(photo)
#       photo.watermark!('Rails')
#       photo.rotate!(90.degrees)
#       photo.resize_to_fit!(300, 300)
#       photo.upload!
#     end
#   end
#
# Records that are passed in are serialized/deserialized using Global
# ID. More information can be found in Arguments.
#
# To enqueue a job to be performed as soon as the queuing system is free:
#
#   ProcessPhotoJob.perform_later(photo)
#
# To enqueue a job to be processed at some point in the future:
#
#   ProcessPhotoJob.set(wait_until: Date.tomorrow.noon).perform_later(photo)
#
# More information can be found in ActiveJob::Core::ClassMethods#set
#
# A job can also be processed immediately without sending to the queue:
#
#  ProcessPhotoJob.perform_now(photo)
#
# == Exceptions
#
# * DeserializationError - Error class for deserialization errors.
# * SerializationError - Error class for serialization errors.

# * <tt>after_enqueue</tt>
# * <tt>before_perform</tt>
# * <tt>around_perform</tt>

  # You can also pass a block that'll be invoked if the retry attempts fail for custom logic rather than letting
  # the exception bubble up. This block is yielded with the job instance as the first and the error instance as the second parameter.
  #
  # ==== Options
  # * <tt>:wait</tt> - Re-enqueues the job with a delay specified either in seconds (default: 3 seconds),
  #   as a computing proc that takes the number of executions so far as an argument, or as a symbol reference of
  #   <tt>:exponentially_longer</tt>, which applies the wait algorithm of <tt>((executions**4) + (Kernel.rand * (executions**4) * jitter)) + 2</tt>
  #   (first wait ~3s, then ~18s, then ~83s, etc)
  # * <tt>:attempts</tt> - Re-enqueues the job the specified number of times (default: 5 attempts)
  # * <tt>:queue</tt> - Re-enqueues the job on a different queue
  # * <tt>:priority</tt> - Re-enqueues the job with a different priority
  # * <tt>:jitter</tt> - A random delay of wait time used when calculating backoff. The default is 15% (0.15) which represents the upper bound of possible wait time (expressed as a percentage)
  #
  # ==== Examples
  #
  #  class RemoteServiceJob < ActiveJob::Base
  #    retry_on CustomAppException # defaults to ~3s wait, 5 attempts
  #    retry_on AnotherCustomAppException, wait: ->(executions) { executions * 2 }

  #    # retry_on Net::ReadTimeout, wait: 5.seconds, jitter: 0.30, attempts: 10

#
# ==== Async
#
# Yes: The Queue Adapter has the ability to run the job in a non-blocking manner.
# It either runs on a separate or forked process, or on a different thread.
#
# No: The job is run in the same process.
#
# ==== Queues
#
# Yes: Jobs may set which queue they are run in with queue_as or by using the set
# method.
#
# ==== Delayed
#
# Yes: The adapter will run the job in the future through perform_later.
#
# (Gem): An additional gem is required to use perform_later with this adapter.
#
# No: The adapter will run jobs at the next opportunity and cannot use perform_later.
#
# N/A: The adapter does not support queuing.
#
# NOTE:
# queue_classic supports job scheduling since version 3.1.
# For older versions you can use the queue_classic-later gem.
#
# ==== Priorities
#
# The order in which jobs are processed can be configured differently depending
# on the adapter.
#
# Job: Any class inheriting from the adapter may set the priority on the job
# object relative to other jobs.
#
# Queue: The adapter can set the priority for job queues, when setting a queue
# with Active Job this will be respected.
#
# Yes: Allows the priority to be set on the job object, at the queue level or
# as default configuration option.
#
# No: The adapter does not allow the priority of jobs to be configured.
#
# N/A: The adapter does not support queuing, and therefore sorting them.
#
# ==== Timeout
#
# When a job will stop after the allotted time.
#
# Job: The timeout can be set for each instance of the job class.
#
# Queue: The timeout is set for all jobs on the queue.
#
# Global: The adapter is configured that all jobs have a maximum run time.
#
# No: The adapter does not allow the timeout of jobs to be configured.
#
# N/A: This adapter does not run in a separate process, and therefore timeout
# is unsupported.
#
# ==== Retries
#
# Job: The number of retries can be set per instance of the job class.
#
# Yes: The Number of retries can be configured globally, for each instance or
# on the queue. This adapter may also present failed instances of the job class
# that can be restarted.
#
# Global: The adapter has a global number of retries.
#
# No: The adapter does not allow the number of retries to be configured.
#
# N/A: The adapter does not run in a separate process, and therefore doesn't
# support retries.
#
# === Async and Inline Queue Adapters
#
# Active Job has two built-in queue adapters intended for development and
# testing: +:async+ and +:inline+.

# == Active Job Async adapter
#
# The Async adapter runs jobs with an in-process thread pool.
#
# This is the default queue adapter. It's well-suited for dev/test since
# it doesn't need an external infrastructure, but it's a poor fit for
# production since it drops pending jobs on restart.
#
# To use this adapter, set queue adapter to +:async+:
#
#   config.active_job.queue_adapter = :async
#
# To configure the adapter's thread pool, instantiate the adapter and
# pass your own config:
#
#   config.active_job.queue_adapter = ActiveJob::QueueAdapters::AsyncAdapter.new \
#     min_threads: 1,
#     max_threads: 2 * Concurrent.processor_count,
#     idletime: 600.seconds
#
# The adapter uses a {Concurrent Ruby}[https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby] thread pool to schedule and execute
# jobs. Since jobs share a single thread pool, long-running jobs will block
# short-lived jobs. Fine for dev/test; bad for production.
class ActiveJob::QueueAdapters::AsyncAdapter
  # See {Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor}[https://ruby-concurrency.github.io/concurrent-ruby/master/Concurrent/ThreadPoolExecutor.html] for executor options.

  # any new jobs following the executor's fallback policy (`caller_runs`).
  # Waits for termination by default. Pass `wait: false` to continue.
  def shutdown(wait: T.unsafe(nil)); end
end

# Note that we don't actually need to serialize the jobs since we're
# performing them in-process, but we do so anyway for parity with other
# adapters and deployment environments. Otherwise, serialization bugs
# may creep in undetected.
