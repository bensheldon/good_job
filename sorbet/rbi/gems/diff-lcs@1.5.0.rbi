    #       [ # hunk
    #         # change

    #
    # The +patch+ method accepts <tt>patchset</tt>s that are enumerable sequences
    # containing either Diff::LCS::Change objects (or a subclass) or the array
    # representations of those objects. Prior to application, array
    # representations of Diff::LCS::Change objects will be reified.

# This will produce a compound array of simple diff change objects. Each

# addition or removal of a single element from one of the two tested
# sequences. The +hunk+ provides the full context for the changes.
#
#     diffs = Diff::LCS.diff(seq1, seq2)
#       # This example shows a simplified array format.
#       # [ [ [ '-',  0, 'a' ] ],   # 1
#       #   [ [ '+',  2, 'd' ] ],   # 2
#       #   [ [ '-',  4, 'h' ],     # 3

# (<tt>'+'</tt>). The third hunk says that the +h+ at position 4 of the
