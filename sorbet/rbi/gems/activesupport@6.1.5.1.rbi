# Backtraces often include many lines that are not relevant for the context
# under review. This makes it hard to find the signal amongst the backtrace
# noise, and adds debugging time. With a BacktraceCleaner, filters and
# silencers are used to remove the noisy lines, so that only the most relevant
# lines remain.
#
# Filters are used to modify lines of data, while silencers are used to remove
# lines entirely. The typical filter use case is to remove lengthy path
# information from the start of each line, and view file paths relevant to the
# app directory instead of the file system root. The typical silencer use case
# is to exclude the output of a noisy library from the backtrace, so that you
# can focus on the rest.

#   bc.clean(exception.backtrace) # perform the cleanup

# and show as much data as possible, you can always call
# <tt>BacktraceCleaner#remove_silencers!</tt>, which will restore the
# backtrace to a pristine state. If you need to reconfigure an existing
# BacktraceCleaner so that it does not filter or modify the paths of any lines
# of the backtrace, you can call <tt>BacktraceCleaner#remove_filters!</tt>

module ActiveSupport::Benchmarkable
  # Allows you to measure the execution time of a block in a template and

  # or possible bottlenecks to get a time reading for the operation. For

  # long; you could wrap it in a benchmark block.
  #
  #  <% benchmark 'Process data files' do %>
  #    <%= expensive_files_operation %>
  #  <% end %>
  #
  # That would add something like "Process data files (345.2ms)" to the log,
  # which you can then use to compare timings when optimizing your code.
  #
  # You may give an optional logger level (<tt>:debug</tt>, <tt>:info</tt>,
  # <tt>:warn</tt>, <tt>:error</tt>) as the <tt>:level</tt> option. The
  # default logger level value is <tt>:info</tt>.

  #    <%= lowlevel_files_operation %>

  #
  # Finally, you can pass true as the third argument to silence all log
  # activity (other than the timing information) from inside the block. This
  # is great for boiling down a noisy block to just a single statement that

# An abstract cache store class. There are multiple cache store
# implementations, each having its own additional features. See the classes
# under the ActiveSupport::Cache module, e.g.
# ActiveSupport::Cache::MemCacheStore. MemCacheStore is currently the most
# popular cache store for large production websites.
#
# Some implementations may not support all methods beyond the basic cache
# methods of +fetch+, +write+, +read+, +exist?+, and +delete+.

#
# Keys are always translated into Strings and are case sensitive. When an
# object is specified as a key and has a +cache_key+ method defined, this
# method will be called to define the key.  Otherwise, the +to_param+
# method will be called. Hashes and Arrays can also be used as keys. The
# elements will be delimited by slashes, and the elements within a Hash
# will be sorted by key so they are consistent.
#
#   cache.read('city') == cache.read(:city)   # => true
#
# Nil values can be cached.
#
# If your cache is on a shared infrastructure, you can define a namespace
# for your cache entries. If a namespace is defined, it will be prefixed on
# to every key. The namespace can be either a static value or a Proc. If it
# is a Proc, it will be invoked when each key is evaluated so that you can
# use application logic to invalidate keys.

  # All caches support auto-expiring content after a specified number of
  # seconds. This value can be specified as an option to the constructor
  # (in which case all entries will be affected), or it can be supplied to
  # the +fetch+ or +write+ method to effect just one entry.
  #
  #   cache = ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore.new(expires_in: 5.minutes)
  #   cache.write(key, value, expires_in: 1.minute) # Set a lower value for one entry
  #
  # Setting <tt>:version</tt> verifies the cache stored under <tt>name</tt>
  # is of the same version. nil is returned on mismatches despite contents.
  # This feature is used to support recyclable cache keys.
  #
  # Setting <tt>:race_condition_ttl</tt> is very useful in situations where
  # a cache entry is used very frequently and is under heavy load. If a
  # cache expires and due to heavy load several different processes will try
  # to read data natively and then they all will try to write to cache. To
  # avoid that case the first process to find an expired cache entry will
  # bump the cache expiration time by the value set in <tt>:race_condition_ttl</tt>.
  # Yes, this process is extending the time for a stale value by another few
  # seconds. Because of extended life of the previous cache, other processes
  # will continue to use slightly stale data for a just a bit longer. In the
  # meantime that first process will go ahead and will write into cache the
  # new value. After that all the processes will start getting the new value.
  # The key is to keep <tt>:race_condition_ttl</tt> small.
  #
  # If the process regenerating the entry errors out, the entry will be
  # regenerated after the specified number of seconds. Also note that the
  # life of stale cache is extended only if it expired recently. Otherwise
  # a new value is generated and <tt>:race_condition_ttl</tt> does not play
  # any role.
  #
  #   # Set all values to expire after one minute.
  #   cache = ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore.new(expires_in: 1.minute)
  #
  #   cache.write('foo', 'original value')
  #   val_1 = nil
  #   val_2 = nil
  #   sleep 60
  #
  #   Thread.new do
  #     val_1 = cache.fetch('foo', race_condition_ttl: 10.seconds) do
  #       sleep 1
  #       'new value 1'
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   Thread.new do
  #     val_2 = cache.fetch('foo', race_condition_ttl: 10.seconds) do
  #       'new value 2'

  #
  #   cache.fetch('foo') # => "original value"
  #   sleep 10 # First thread extended the life of cache by another 10 seconds
  #   cache.fetch('foo') # => "new value 1"
  #   val_1 # => "new value 1"
  #   val_2 # => "original value"
  #
  # Other options will be handled by the specific cache store implementation.
  # Internally, #fetch calls #read_entry, and calls #write_entry on a cache
  # miss. +options+ will be passed to the #read and #write calls.
  #
  # For example, MemCacheStore's #write method supports the +:raw+
  # option, which tells the memcached server to store all values as strings.
  # We can use this option with #fetch too:
  #
  #   cache = ActiveSupport::Cache::MemCacheStore.new
  #   cache.fetch("foo", force: true, raw: true) do
  #     :bar
  #   end
  #   cache.fetch('foo') # => "bar"
  def fetch(name, options = T.unsafe(nil), &block); end

  # Fetches data from the cache, using the given keys. If there is data in
  # the cache with the given keys, then that data is returned. Otherwise,
  # the supplied block is called for each key for which there was no data,
  # and the result will be written to the cache and returned.
  # Therefore, you need to pass a block that returns the data to be written
  # to the cache. If you do not want to write the cache when the cache is
  # not found, use #read_multi.
  #
  # Returns a hash with the data for each of the names. For example:
  #
  #   cache.write("bim", "bam")
  #   cache.fetch_multi("bim", "unknown_key") do |key|
  #     "Fallback value for key: #{key}"
  #   end
  #   # => { "bim" => "bam",
  #   #      "unknown_key" => "Fallback value for key: unknown_key" }
  #

  #
  #   cache.fetch_multi("fizz", expires_in: 5.seconds) do |key|

# Callbacks are code hooks that are run at key points in an object's life cycle.
# The typical use case is to have a base class define a set of callbacks
# relevant to the other functionality it supplies, so that subclasses can
# install callbacks that enhance or modify the base functionality without
# needing to override or redefine methods of the base class.
#
# Mixing in this module allows you to define the events in the object's
# life cycle that will support callbacks (via +ClassMethods.define_callbacks+),
# set the instance methods, procs, or callback objects to be called (via
# +ClassMethods.set_callback+), and run the installed callbacks at the
# appropriate times (via +run_callbacks+).
#
# By default callbacks are halted by throwing +:abort+.
# See +ClassMethods.define_callbacks+ for details.
#
# Three kinds of callbacks are supported: before callbacks, run before a
# certain event; after callbacks, run after the event; and around callbacks,
# blocks that surround the event, triggering it when they yield. Callback code
# can be contained in instance methods, procs or lambdas, or callback objects
# that respond to certain predetermined methods. See +ClassMethods.set_callback+

# A typical module looks like this:
#
#   module M
#     def self.included(base)
#       base.extend ClassMethods
#       base.class_eval do
#         scope :disabled, -> { where(disabled: true) }
#       end
#     end
#
#     module ClassMethods
#       ...
#     end
#   end
#
# By using <tt>ActiveSupport::Concern</tt> the above module could instead be
# written as:
#
#   require "active_support/concern"
#
#   module M
#     extend ActiveSupport::Concern
#
#     included do
#       scope :disabled, -> { where(disabled: true) }
#     end
#
#     class_methods do
#       ...
#     end
#   end
#
# Moreover, it gracefully handles module dependencies. Given a +Foo+ module
# and a +Bar+ module which depends on the former, we would typically write the
# following:
#
#   module Foo
#     def self.included(base)
#       base.class_eval do
#         def self.method_injected_by_foo
#           ...
#         end
#       end
#     end
#   end
#
#   module Bar
#     def self.included(base)
#       base.method_injected_by_foo
#     end
#   end
#
#   class Host
#     include Foo # We need to include this dependency for Bar
#     include Bar # Bar is the module that Host really needs
#   end
#
# But why should +Host+ care about +Bar+'s dependencies, namely +Foo+? We
# could try to hide these from +Host+ directly including +Foo+ in +Bar+:
#
#   module Bar
#     include Foo
#     def self.included(base)
#       base.method_injected_by_foo
#     end
#   end
#
#   class Host
#     include Bar
#   end
#
# Unfortunately this won't work, since when +Foo+ is included, its <tt>base</tt>
# is the +Bar+ module, not the +Host+ class. With <tt>ActiveSupport::Concern</tt>,
# module dependencies are properly resolved:
#
#   require "active_support/concern"
#
#   module Foo
#     extend ActiveSupport::Concern
#     included do
#       def self.method_injected_by_foo
#         ...
#       end
#     end
#   end
#
#   module Bar
#     extend ActiveSupport::Concern
#     include Foo
#
#     included do
#       self.method_injected_by_foo
#     end
#   end
#
#   class Host
#     include Bar # It works, now Bar takes care of its dependencies
#   end
#
# === Prepending concerns
#
# Just like <tt>include</tt>, concerns also support <tt>prepend</tt> with a corresponding
# <tt>prepended do</tt> callback. <tt>module ClassMethods</tt> or <tt>class_methods do</tt> are
# prepended as well.
#
# <tt>prepend</tt> is also used for any dependencies.

  #
  # Default approximations are provided for Western/Latin characters,
  # e.g, "ø", "ñ", "é", "ß", etc.
  #
  # This method is I18n aware, so you can set up custom approximations for a
  # locale. This can be useful, for example, to transliterate German's "ü"
  # and "ö" to "ue" and "oe", or to add support for transliterating Russian
  # to ASCII.
  #
  # In order to make your custom transliterations available, you must set
  # them as the <tt>i18n.transliterate.rule</tt> i18n key:
  #
  #   # Store the transliterations in locales/de.yml
  #   i18n:
  #     transliterate:
  #       rule:
  #         ü: "ue"
  #         ö: "oe"
  #
  #   # Or set them using Ruby
  #   I18n.backend.store_translations(:de, i18n: {
  #     transliterate: {
  #       rule: {
  #         'ü' => 'ue',
  #         'ö' => 'oe'
  #       }
  #     }
  #   })
  #
  # The value for <tt>i18n.transliterate.rule</tt> can be a simple Hash that
  # maps characters to ASCII approximations as shown above, or, for more
  # complex requirements, a Proc:
  #
  #   I18n.backend.store_translations(:de, i18n: {
  #     transliterate: {
  #       rule: ->(string) { MyTransliterator.transliterate(string) }
  #     }
  #   })
  #
  # Now you can have different transliterations for each locale:
  #
  #   transliterate('Jürgen', locale: :en)
  #   # => "Jurgen"
  #
  #   transliterate('Jürgen', locale: :de)
  #   # => "Juergen"
  #

  # Other encodings will raise an ArgumentError.

# <tt>ActiveSupport::LogSubscriber</tt> is an object set to consume
# <tt>ActiveSupport::Notifications</tt> with the sole purpose of logging them.
# The log subscriber dispatches notifications to a registered object based
# on its given namespace.
#
# An example would be Active Record log subscriber responsible for logging
# queries:
#
#   module ActiveRecord
#     class LogSubscriber < ActiveSupport::LogSubscriber
#       def sql(event)
#         info "#{event.payload[:name]} (#{event.duration}) #{event.payload[:sql]}"
#       end
#     end
#   end
#
# And it's finally registered as:
#
#   ActiveRecord::LogSubscriber.attach_to :active_record
#
# Since we need to know all instance methods before attaching the log
# subscriber, the line above should be called after your
# <tt>ActiveRecord::LogSubscriber</tt> definition.
#
# A logger also needs to be set with <tt>ActiveRecord::LogSubscriber.logger=</tt>.
# This is assigned automatically in a Rails environment.
#
# After configured, whenever a <tt>"sql.active_record"</tt> notification is published,
# it will properly dispatch the event
# (<tt>ActiveSupport::Notifications::Event</tt>) to the sql method.
#
# Being an <tt>ActiveSupport::Notifications</tt> consumer,
# <tt>ActiveSupport::LogSubscriber</tt> exposes a simple interface to check if
# instrumented code raises an exception. It is common to log a different
# message in case of an error, and this can be achieved by extending
# the previous example:
#
#   module ActiveRecord
#     class LogSubscriber < ActiveSupport::LogSubscriber
#       def sql(event)
#         exception = event.payload[:exception]
#
#         if exception
#           exception_object = event.payload[:exception_object]
#
#           error "[ERROR] #{event.payload[:name]}: #{exception.join(', ')} " \
#                 "(#{exception_object.backtrace.first})"
#         else
#           # standard logger code
#         end
#       end
#     end
#   end
#
# Log subscriber also has some helpers to deal with logging and automatically
# flushes all logs when the request finishes
# (via <tt>action_dispatch.callback</tt> notification) in a Rails environment.

# === Making messages expire
#
# By default messages last forever and verifying one year from now will still
# return the original value. But messages can be set to expire at a given
# time with +:expires_in+ or +:expires_at+.
#
#   crypt.encrypt_and_sign(parcel, expires_in: 1.month)
#   crypt.encrypt_and_sign(doowad, expires_at: Time.now.end_of_year)
#
# Then the messages can be verified and returned up to the expire time.
# Thereafter, verifying returns +nil+.
#
# === Rotating keys
#
# MessageEncryptor also supports rotating out old configurations by falling
# back to a stack of encryptors. Call +rotate+ to build and add an encryptor
# so +decrypt_and_verify+ will also try the fallback.
#
# By default any rotated encryptors use the values of the primary
# encryptor unless specified otherwise.
#
# You'd give your encryptor the new defaults:
#
#   crypt = ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor.new(@secret, cipher: "aes-256-gcm")
#
# Then gradually rotate the old values out by adding them as fallbacks. Any message
# generated with the old values will then work until the rotation is removed.
#
#   crypt.rotate old_secret            # Fallback to an old secret instead of @secret.
#   crypt.rotate cipher: "aes-256-cbc" # Fallback to an old cipher instead of aes-256-gcm.
#
# Though if both the secret and the cipher was changed at the same time,
# the above should be combined into:

# +MessageVerifier+ makes it easy to generate and verify messages which are

# This is useful for cases like remember-me tokens and auto-unsubscribe links

# hash upon initialization:
#
#   @verifier = ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier.new('s3Krit', serializer: YAML)
#
# +MessageVerifier+ creates HMAC signatures using SHA1 hash algorithm by default.

# Likewise, if a message has no purpose it won't be returned when verifying with
# a specific purpose.
#
#   token = @verifier.generate("the conversation is lively")
#   @verifier.verified(token, purpose: :scare_tactics) # => nil

#
#   @verifier.verify(token, purpose: :scare_tactics)   # => ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier::InvalidSignature
#   @verifier.verify(token)                            # => "the conversation is lively"
#
# === Making messages expire
#
# By default messages last forever and verifying one year from now will still

#
#   @verifier.generate(parcel, expires_in: 1.month)

# Then the messages can be verified and returned up to the expire time.

# = Notifications
#
# <tt>ActiveSupport::Notifications</tt> provides an instrumentation API for
# Ruby.
#
# == Instrumenters
#
# To instrument an event you just need to do:
#
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument('render', extra: :information) do
#     render plain: 'Foo'
#   end
#
# That first executes the block and then notifies all subscribers once done.
#
# In the example above +render+ is the name of the event, and the rest is called
# the _payload_. The payload is a mechanism that allows instrumenters to pass
# extra information to subscribers. Payloads consist of a hash whose contents
# are arbitrary and generally depend on the event.
#
# == Subscribers
#
# You can consume those events and the information they provide by registering
# a subscriber.
#
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe('render') do |name, start, finish, id, payload|
#     name    # => String, name of the event (such as 'render' from above)
#     start   # => Time, when the instrumented block started execution
#     finish  # => Time, when the instrumented block ended execution
#     id      # => String, unique ID for the instrumenter that fired the event
#     payload # => Hash, the payload
#   end
#
# Here, the +start+ and +finish+ values represent wall-clock time. If you are
# concerned about accuracy, you can register a monotonic subscriber.
#
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.monotonic_subscribe('render') do |name, start, finish, id, payload|
#     name    # => String, name of the event (such as 'render' from above)
#     start   # => Monotonic time, when the instrumented block started execution
#     finish  # => Monotonic time, when the instrumented block ended execution
#     id      # => String, unique ID for the instrumenter that fired the event
#     payload # => Hash, the payload
#   end
#
# The +start+ and +finish+ values above represent monotonic time.
#
# For instance, let's store all "render" events in an array:
#
#   events = []
#
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe('render') do |*args|
#     events << ActiveSupport::Notifications::Event.new(*args)
#   end
#
# That code returns right away, you are just subscribing to "render" events.
# The block is saved and will be called whenever someone instruments "render":
#
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument('render', extra: :information) do
#     render plain: 'Foo'
#   end
#
#   event = events.first
#   event.name      # => "render"
#   event.duration  # => 10 (in milliseconds)
#   event.payload   # => { extra: :information }
#
# The block in the <tt>subscribe</tt> call gets the name of the event, start
# timestamp, end timestamp, a string with a unique identifier for that event's instrumenter
# (something like "535801666f04d0298cd6"), and a hash with the payload, in
# that order.
#
# If an exception happens during that particular instrumentation the payload will
# have a key <tt>:exception</tt> with an array of two elements as value: a string with
# the name of the exception class, and the exception message.
# The <tt>:exception_object</tt> key of the payload will have the exception
# itself as the value:
#
#   event.payload[:exception]         # => ["ArgumentError", "Invalid value"]
#   event.payload[:exception_object]  # => #<ArgumentError: Invalid value>
#
# As the earlier example depicts, the class <tt>ActiveSupport::Notifications::Event</tt>
# is able to take the arguments as they come and provide an object-oriented
# interface to that data.
#
# It is also possible to pass an object which responds to <tt>call</tt> method
# as the second parameter to the <tt>subscribe</tt> method instead of a block:
#
#   module ActionController
#     class PageRequest
#       def call(name, started, finished, unique_id, payload)
#         Rails.logger.debug ['notification:', name, started, finished, unique_id, payload].join(' ')
#       end
#     end
#   end
#
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe('process_action.action_controller', ActionController::PageRequest.new)
#
# resulting in the following output within the logs including a hash with the payload:
#
#   notification: process_action.action_controller 2012-04-13 01:08:35 +0300 2012-04-13 01:08:35 +0300 af358ed7fab884532ec7 {

#
# You can also subscribe to all events whose name matches a certain regexp:
#
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe(/render/) do |*args|
#     ...
#   end
#
# and even pass no argument to <tt>subscribe</tt>, in which case you are subscribing
# to all events.
#
# == Temporary Subscriptions
#
# Sometimes you do not want to subscribe to an event for the entire life of
# the application. There are two ways to unsubscribe.
#
# WARNING: The instrumentation framework is designed for long-running subscribers,
# use this feature sparingly because it wipes some internal caches and that has
# a negative impact on performance.
#
# === Subscribe While a Block Runs
#
# You can subscribe to some event temporarily while some block runs. For
# example, in
#
#   callback = lambda {|*args| ... }
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribed(callback, "sql.active_record") do
#     ...
#   end
#
# the callback will be called for all "sql.active_record" events instrumented
# during the execution of the block. The callback is unsubscribed automatically
# after that.
#
# To record +started+ and +finished+ values with monotonic time,
# specify the optional <tt>:monotonic</tt> option to the
# <tt>subscribed</tt> method. The <tt>:monotonic</tt> option is set
# to +false+ by default.
#
#   callback = lambda {|name, started, finished, unique_id, payload| ... }
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribed(callback, "sql.active_record", monotonic: true) do
#     ...
#   end
#
# === Manual Unsubscription
#
# The +subscribe+ method returns a subscriber object:
#
#   subscriber = ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe("render") do |*args|
#     ...
#   end
#
# To prevent that block from being called anymore, just unsubscribe passing
# that reference:
#
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.unsubscribe(subscriber)
#
# You can also unsubscribe by passing the name of the subscriber object. Note
# that this will unsubscribe all subscriptions with the given name:
#
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.unsubscribe("render")
#
# Subscribers using a regexp or other pattern-matching object will remain subscribed
# to all events that match their original pattern, unless those events match a string
# passed to +unsubscribe+:
#
#   subscriber = ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe(/render/) { }
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.unsubscribe('render_template.action_view')
#   subscriber.matches?('render_template.action_view') # => false
#   subscriber.matches?('render_partial.action_view') # => true
#
# == Default Queue
#
# Notifications ships with a queue implementation that consumes and publishes events
# to all log subscribers. You can use any queue implementation you want.

    #     @event = ActiveSupport::Notifications::Event.new(*args)

    #     id      # => String, unique ID for the instrumenter that fired the event
    #     payload # => Hash, the payload
    #   end

    # it will yield an event object to the block:

  # Formats a +number+ into a currency string (e.g., $13.65). You
  # can customize the format in the +options+ hash.
  #
  # The currency unit and number formatting of the current locale will be used
  # unless otherwise specified in the provided options. No currency conversion
  # is performed. If the user is given a way to change their locale, they will
  # also be able to change the relative value of the currency displayed with
  # this helper. If your application will ever support multiple locales, you
  # may want to specify a constant <tt>:locale</tt> option or consider
  # using a library capable of currency conversion.
  #
  # ==== Options
  #
  # * <tt>:locale</tt> - Sets the locale to be used for formatting
  #   (defaults to current locale).
  # * <tt>:precision</tt> - Sets the level of precision (defaults
  #   to 2).
  # * <tt>:round_mode</tt> - Determine how rounding is performed
  #   (defaults to :default. See BigDecimal::mode)
  # * <tt>:unit</tt> - Sets the denomination of the currency
  #   (defaults to "$").
  # * <tt>:separator</tt> - Sets the separator between the units
  #   (defaults to ".").
  # * <tt>:delimiter</tt> - Sets the thousands delimiter (defaults
  #   to ",").
  # * <tt>:format</tt> - Sets the format for non-negative numbers
  #   (defaults to "%u%n").  Fields are <tt>%u</tt> for the
  #   currency, and <tt>%n</tt> for the number.
  # * <tt>:negative_format</tt> - Sets the format for negative
  #   numbers (defaults to prepending a hyphen to the formatted
  #   number given by <tt>:format</tt>).  Accepts the same fields
  #   than <tt>:format</tt>, except <tt>%n</tt> is here the
  #   absolute value of the number.
  # * <tt>:strip_insignificant_zeros</tt> - If +true+ removes
  #   insignificant zeros after the decimal separator (defaults to
  #   +false+).
  #
  # ==== Examples
  #
  #   number_to_currency(1234567890.50)                # => "$1,234,567,890.50"

  # Pretty prints (formats and approximates) a number in a way it
  # is more readable by humans (e.g.: 1200000000 becomes "1.2
  # Billion"). This is useful for numbers that can get very large
  # (and too hard to read).
  #
  # See <tt>number_to_human_size</tt> if you want to print a file
  # size.
  #
  # You can also define your own unit-quantifier names if you want
  # to use other decimal units (e.g.: 1500 becomes "1.5
  # kilometers", 0.150 becomes "150 milliliters", etc). You may
  # define a wide range of unit quantifiers, even fractional ones
  # (centi, deci, mili, etc).
  #
  # ==== Options
  #
  # * <tt>:locale</tt> - Sets the locale to be used for formatting
  #   (defaults to current locale).
  # * <tt>:precision</tt> - Sets the precision of the number
  #   (defaults to 3).
  # * <tt>:round_mode</tt> - Determine how rounding is performed
  #   (defaults to :default. See BigDecimal::mode)
  # * <tt>:significant</tt> - If +true+, precision will be the number
  #   of significant_digits. If +false+, the number of fractional
  #   digits (defaults to +true+)
  # * <tt>:separator</tt> - Sets the separator between the
  #   fractional and integer digits (defaults to ".").
  # * <tt>:delimiter</tt> - Sets the thousands delimiter (defaults
  #   to "").
  # * <tt>:strip_insignificant_zeros</tt> - If +true+ removes
  #   insignificant zeros after the decimal separator (defaults to
  #   +true+)
  # * <tt>:units</tt> - A Hash of unit quantifier names. Or a
  #   string containing an i18n scope where to find this hash. It
  #   might have the following keys:
  #   * *integers*: <tt>:unit</tt>, <tt>:ten</tt>,
  #     <tt>:hundred</tt>, <tt>:thousand</tt>, <tt>:million</tt>,
  #     <tt>:billion</tt>, <tt>:trillion</tt>,
  #     <tt>:quadrillion</tt>
  #   * *fractionals*: <tt>:deci</tt>, <tt>:centi</tt>,
  #     <tt>:mili</tt>, <tt>:micro</tt>, <tt>:nano</tt>,
  #     <tt>:pico</tt>, <tt>:femto</tt>
  # * <tt>:format</tt> - Sets the format of the output string
  #   (defaults to "%n %u"). The field types are:
  #   * %u - The quantifier (ex.: 'thousand')
  #   * %n - The number

  #     thousand:
  #       one: "kilometer"
  #       other: "kilometers"
  #     billion: "gazillion-distance"
  #
  # Then you could do:

  #   number_to_human(543934, units: :distance)            # => "544 kilometers"
  #   number_to_human(54393498, units: :distance)          # => "54400 kilometers"
  #   number_to_human(54393498000, units: :distance)       # => "54.4 gazillion-distance"
  #   number_to_human(343, units: :distance, precision: 1) # => "300 meters"
  #   number_to_human(1, units: :distance)                 # => "1 meter"
  #   number_to_human(0.34, units: :distance)              # => "34 centimeters"

#
# sets a connection handler local to the current thread, and
#
#   ActiveRecord::RuntimeRegistry.connection_handler
#
# returns a connection handler local to the current thread.
#
# This feature is accomplished by instantiating the class and storing the
# instance as a thread local keyed by the class name. In the example above
# a key "ActiveRecord::RuntimeRegistry" is stored in <tt>Thread.current</tt>.

    # Wraps its argument in an array unless it is already an array (or array-like).
    #
    # Specifically:
    #
    # * If the argument is +nil+ an empty array is returned.
    # * Otherwise, if the argument responds to +to_ary+ it is invoked, and its result returned.
    # * Otherwise, returns an array with the argument as its single element.
    #
    #     Array.wrap(nil)       # => []
    #     Array.wrap([1, 2, 3]) # => [1, 2, 3]
    #     Array.wrap(0)         # => [0]
    #
    # This method is similar in purpose to <tt>Kernel#Array</tt>, but there are some differences:
    #
    # * If the argument responds to +to_ary+ the method is invoked. <tt>Kernel#Array</tt>
    #   moves on to try +to_a+ if the returned value is +nil+, but <tt>Array.wrap</tt> returns
    #   an array with the argument as its single element right away.
    # * If the returned value from +to_ary+ is neither +nil+ nor an +Array+ object, <tt>Kernel#Array</tt>
    #   raises an exception, while <tt>Array.wrap</tt> does not, it just returns the value.
    # * It does not call +to_a+ on the argument, if the argument does not respond to +to_ary+
    #   it returns an array with the argument as its single element.
    #
    # The last point is easily explained with some enumerables:
    #
    #   Array(foo: :bar)      # => [[:foo, :bar]]
    #   Array.wrap(foo: :bar) # => [{:foo=>:bar}]
    #
    # There's also a related idiom that uses the splat operator:
    #
    #   [*object]
    #
    # which returns <tt>[]</tt> for +nil+, but calls to <tt>Array(object)</tt> otherwise.
    #
    # The differences with <tt>Kernel#Array</tt> explained above
    # apply to the rest of <tt>object</tt>s.

  #
  # That's why a JSON string is returned. The JSON literal is not numeric, but

class Class < ::Module
  # Declare a class-level attribute whose value is inheritable by subclasses.
  # Subclasses can change their own value and it will not impact parent class.
  #
  # ==== Options
  #
  # * <tt>:instance_reader</tt> - Sets the instance reader method (defaults to true).
  # * <tt>:instance_writer</tt> - Sets the instance writer method (defaults to true).
  # * <tt>:instance_accessor</tt> - Sets both instance methods (defaults to true).
  # * <tt>:instance_predicate</tt> - Sets a predicate method (defaults to true).
  # * <tt>:default</tt> - Sets a default value for the attribute (defaults to nil).
  #
  # ==== Examples
  #
  #   class Base
  #     class_attribute :setting
  #   end
  #
  #   class Subclass < Base
  #   end
  #
  #   Base.setting = true
  #   Subclass.setting            # => true
  #   Subclass.setting = false
  #   Subclass.setting            # => false
  #   Base.setting                # => true
  #
  # In the above case as long as Subclass does not assign a value to setting
  # by performing <tt>Subclass.setting = _something_</tt>, <tt>Subclass.setting</tt>
  # would read value assigned to parent class. Once Subclass assigns a value then
  # the value assigned by Subclass would be returned.
  #
  # This matches normal Ruby method inheritance: think of writing an attribute
  # on a subclass as overriding the reader method. However, you need to be aware
  # when using +class_attribute+ with mutable structures as +Array+ or +Hash+.
  # In such cases, you don't want to do changes in place. Instead use setters:
  #
  #   Base.setting = []
  #   Base.setting                # => []
  #   Subclass.setting            # => []
  #
  #   # Appending in child changes both parent and child because it is the same object:
  #   Subclass.setting << :foo
  #   Base.setting               # => [:foo]
  #   Subclass.setting           # => [:foo]
  #
  #   # Use setters to not propagate changes:
  #   Base.setting = []
  #   Subclass.setting += [:foo]
  #   Base.setting               # => []
  #   Subclass.setting           # => [:foo]
  #
  # For convenience, an instance predicate method is defined as well.
  # To skip it, pass <tt>instance_predicate: false</tt>.
  #
  #   Subclass.setting?       # => false
  #
  # Instances may overwrite the class value in the same way:
  #
  #   Base.setting = true
  #   object = Base.new
  #   object.setting          # => true
  #   object.setting = false
  #   object.setting          # => false
  #   Base.setting            # => true
  #
  # To opt out of the instance reader method, pass <tt>instance_reader: false</tt>.
  #
  #   object.setting          # => NoMethodError
  #   object.setting?         # => NoMethodError
  #
  # To opt out of the instance writer method, pass <tt>instance_writer: false</tt>.
  #
  #   object.setting = false  # => NoMethodError
  #
  # To opt out of both instance methods, pass <tt>instance_accessor: false</tt>.

  #
  # WARNING: this helper only works with valid JSON. Using this on non-JSON values

  # * <tt>:to</tt> - Specifies the target object name as a symbol or string
  # * <tt>:prefix</tt> - Prefixes the new method with the target name or a custom prefix
  # * <tt>:allow_nil</tt> - If set to true, prevents a +Module::DelegationError+
  #   from being raised
  # * <tt>:private</tt> - If set to true, changes method visibility to private
  #
  # The macro receives one or more method names (specified as symbols or
  # strings) and the name of the target object via the <tt>:to</tt> option
  # (also a symbol or string).
  #
  # Delegation is particularly useful with Active Record associations:
  #
  #   class Greeter < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     def hello
  #       'hello'
  #     end
  #
  #     def goodbye

  #     belongs_to :greeter
  #     delegate :hello, to: :greeter
  #   end
  #
  #   Foo.new.hello   # => "hello"
  #   Foo.new.goodbye # => NoMethodError: undefined method `goodbye' for #<Foo:0x1af30c>
  #
  # Multiple delegates to the same target are allowed:
  #
  #   class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     belongs_to :greeter
  #     delegate :hello, :goodbye, to: :greeter
  #   end
  #
  #   Foo.new.goodbye # => "goodbye"
  #
  # Methods can be delegated to instance variables, class variables, or constants
  # by providing them as a symbols:
  #
  #   class Foo
  #     CONSTANT_ARRAY = [0,1,2,3]
  #     @@class_array  = [4,5,6,7]
  #
  #     def initialize
  #       @instance_array = [8,9,10,11]
  #     end
  #     delegate :sum, to: :CONSTANT_ARRAY
  #     delegate :min, to: :@@class_array
  #     delegate :max, to: :@instance_array
  #   end
  #
  #   Foo.new.sum # => 6
  #   Foo.new.min # => 4
  #   Foo.new.max # => 11
  #
  # It's also possible to delegate a method to the class by using +:class+:
  #
  #   class Foo
  #     def self.hello
  #       "world"
  #     end
  #
  #     delegate :hello, to: :class
  #   end
  #
  #   Foo.new.hello # => "world"
  #
  # Delegates can optionally be prefixed using the <tt>:prefix</tt> option. If the value
  # is <tt>true</tt>, the delegate methods are prefixed with the name of the object being
  # delegated to.
  #
  #   Person = Struct.new(:name, :address)
  #
  #   class Invoice < Struct.new(:client)

# = Bite-sized separation of concerns
#
# We often find ourselves with a medium-sized chunk of behavior that we'd
# like to extract, but only mix in to a single class.
#
# Extracting a plain old Ruby object to encapsulate it and collaborate or
# delegate to the original object is often a good choice, but when there's
# no additional state to encapsulate or we're making DSL-style declarations
# about the parent class, introducing new collaborators can obfuscate rather
# than simplify.
#
# The typical route is to just dump everything in a monolithic class, perhaps
# with a comment, as a least-bad alternative. Using modules in separate files
# means tedious sifting to get a big-picture view.
#
# = Dissatisfying ways to separate small concerns
#
# == Using comments:
#
#   class Todo < ApplicationRecord
#     # Other todo implementation
#     # ...
#
#     ## Event tracking
#     has_many :events
#
#     before_create :track_creation
#
#     private
#       def track_creation
#         # ...
#       end
#   end
#
# == With an inline module:
#
# Noisy syntax.
#
#   class Todo < ApplicationRecord
#     # Other todo implementation
#     # ...
#
#     module EventTracking
#       extend ActiveSupport::Concern
#
#       included do
#         has_many :events
#         before_create :track_creation
#       end
#
#       private
#         def track_creation
#           # ...
#         end
#     end
#     include EventTracking
#   end
#
# == Mix-in noise exiled to its own file:
#
# Once our chunk of behavior starts pushing the scroll-to-understand-it
# boundary, we give in and move it to a separate file. At this size, the
# increased overhead can be a reasonable tradeoff even if it reduces our
# at-a-glance perception of how things work.
#
#   class Todo < ApplicationRecord
#     # Other todo implementation
#     # ...
#
#     include TodoEventTracking
#   end
#
# = Introducing Module#concerning
#
# By quieting the mix-in noise, we arrive at a natural, low-ceremony way to
# separate bite-sized concerns.
#
#   class Todo < ApplicationRecord
#     # Other todo implementation
#     # ...
#
#     concerning :EventTracking do
#       included do
#         has_many :events
#         before_create :track_creation
#       end
#
#       private
#         def track_creation
#           # ...
#         end
#     end
#   end
#
#   Todo.ancestors
#   # => [Todo, Todo::EventTracking, ApplicationRecord, Object]
#
# This small step has some wonderful ripple effects. We can
# * grok the behavior of our class in one glance,
# * clean up monolithic junk-drawer classes by separating their concerns, and
# * stop leaning on protected/private for crude "this is internal stuff" modularity.

# Most objects are cloneable, but not all. For example you can't dup methods:
#
#   method(:puts).dup # => TypeError: allocator undefined for Method
#
# Classes may signal their instances are not duplicable removing +dup+/+clone+
# or raising exceptions from them. So, to dup an arbitrary object you normally
# use an optimistic approach and are ready to catch an exception, say:
#
#   arbitrary_object.dup rescue object
#
# Rails dups objects in a few critical spots where they are not that arbitrary.
# That rescue is very expensive (like 40 times slower than a predicate), and it
# is often triggered.
#
# That's why we hardcode the following cases and check duplicable? instead of
# using that rescue idiom.

  # An elegant way to factor duplication out of options passed to a series of
  # method calls. Each method called in the block, with the block variable as
  # the receiver, will have its options merged with the default +options+ hash
  # provided. Each method called on the block variable must take an options
  # hash as its final argument.
  #
  # Without <tt>with_options</tt>, this code contains duplication:
  #
  #   class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     has_many :customers, dependent: :destroy
  #     has_many :products,  dependent: :destroy
  #     has_many :invoices,  dependent: :destroy
  #     has_many :expenses,  dependent: :destroy
  #   end
  #
  # Using <tt>with_options</tt>, we can remove the duplication:
  #
  #   class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     with_options dependent: :destroy do |assoc|
  #       assoc.has_many :customers
  #       assoc.has_many :products
  #       assoc.has_many :invoices
  #       assoc.has_many :expenses
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # It can also be used with an explicit receiver:
  #
  #   I18n.with_options locale: user.locale, scope: 'newsletter' do |i18n|
  #     subject i18n.t :subject
  #     body    i18n.t :body, user_name: user.name
  #   end
  #
  # When you don't pass an explicit receiver, it executes the whole block
  # in merging options context:
  #
  #   class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     with_options dependent: :destroy do
  #       has_many :customers
  #       has_many :products
  #       has_many :invoices
  #       has_many :expenses
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # <tt>with_options</tt> can also be nested since the call is forwarded to its receiver.
  #
  # NOTE: Each nesting level will merge inherited defaults in addition to their own.
  #
  #   class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     with_options if: :persisted?, length: { minimum: 50 } do
  #       validates :content, if: -> { content.present? }
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # The code is equivalent to:
  #
  #   validates :content, length: { minimum: 50 }, if: -> { content.present? }
  #
  # Hence the inherited default for +if+ key is ignored.
  #
  # NOTE: You cannot call class methods implicitly inside of with_options.
  # You can access these methods using the class name instead:
  #
  #   class Phone < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     enum phone_number_type: { home: 0, office: 1, mobile: 2 }
  #
  #     with_options presence: true do

  # == Multibyte proxy
  #

  # class. If the proxy class doesn't respond to a certain method, it's forwarded to the encapsulated string.

  #
  # == Interoperability and configuration
  #
  # The Chars object tries to be as interchangeable with String objects as possible: sorting and comparing between
  # String and Char work like expected. The bang! methods change the internal string representation in the Chars
  # object. Interoperability problems can be resolved easily with a +to_s+ call.
