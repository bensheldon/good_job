    #   loader.push_dir(__dir__)

    # if you require "my_gem", as Bundler would do, this happens while setting
    # up autoloads:

    #   1. Object.autoload?(:MyGem) returns `nil` because the autoload for
    #      the constant is issued by Zeitwerk while the same file is being
    #      required.
    #   2. The constant `MyGem` is undefined while setup runs.
    #
    # Therefore, a directory `lib/my_gem` would autovivify a module according to
    # the existing information. But that would be wrong.

    # To overcome this fundamental limitation, we keep track of the constant
    # paths that are in this situation ---in the example above, "MyGem"--- and
