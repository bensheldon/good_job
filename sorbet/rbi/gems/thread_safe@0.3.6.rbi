# This class provides a trivial way to synchronize all calls to a given object
# by wrapping it with a `Delegator` that performs `Monitor#enter/exit` calls
# around the delegated `#send`. Example:
#
#   array = [] # not thread-safe on many impls
#   array = SynchronizedDelegator.new([]) # thread-safe
#
# A simple `Monitor` provides a very coarse-grained way to synchronize a given
# object, in that it will cause synchronization for methods that have no need
# for it, but this is a trivial way to get thread-safety where none may exist
# currently on some implementations.

# A Ruby port of the Doug Lea's jsr166e.ConcurrentHashMapV8 class version 1.59
# available in public domain.
#
# Original source code available here:
# http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/jsr166/src/jsr166e/ConcurrentHashMapV8.java?revision=1.59
#
# The Ruby port skips out the +TreeBin+ (red-black trees for use in bins whose
# size exceeds a threshold).
#
# A hash table supporting full concurrency of retrievals and high expected
# concurrency for updates. However, even though all operations are
# thread-safe, retrieval operations do _not_ entail locking, and there is
# _not_ any support for locking the entire table in a way that prevents all
# access.
#
# Retrieval operations generally do not block, so may overlap with update
# operations. Retrievals reflect the results of the most recently _completed_
# update operations holding upon their onset. (More formally, an update
# operation for a given key bears a _happens-before_ relation with any (non
# +nil+) retrieval for that key reporting the updated value.) For aggregate
# operations such as +clear()+, concurrent retrievals may reflect insertion or
# removal of only some entries. Similarly, the +each_pair+ iterator yields
# elements reflecting the state of the hash table at some point at or since
# the start of the +each_pair+. Bear in mind that the results of aggregate
# status methods including +size()+ and +empty?+} are typically useful only
# when a map is not undergoing concurrent updates in other threads. Otherwise
# the results of these methods reflect transient states that may be adequate
# for monitoring or estimation purposes, but not for program control.
#
# The table is dynamically expanded when there are too many collisions (i.e.,
# keys that have distinct hash codes but fall into the same slot modulo the
# table size), with the expected average effect of maintaining roughly two
# bins per mapping (corresponding to a 0.75 load factor threshold for
# resizing). There may be much variance around this average as mappings are
# added and removed, but overall, this maintains a commonly accepted
# time/space tradeoff for hash tables. However, resizing this or any other
# kind of hash table may be a relatively slow operation. When possible, it is
# a good idea to provide a size estimate as an optional :initial_capacity
# initializer argument. An additional optional :load_factor constructor
# argument provides a further means of customizing initial table capacity by
# specifying the table density to be used in calculating the amount of space
# to allocate for the given number of elements. Note that using many keys with
# exactly the same +hash+ is a sure way to slow down performance of any hash
# table.
#
# ## Design overview
#
# The primary design goal of this hash table is to maintain concurrent
# readability (typically method +[]+, but also iteration and related methods)
# while minimizing update contention. Secondary goals are to keep space
# consumption about the same or better than plain +Hash+, and to support high
# initial insertion rates on an empty table by many threads.
#
# Each key-value mapping is held in a +Node+. The validation-based approach
# explained below leads to a lot of code sprawl because retry-control
# precludes factoring into smaller methods.
#
# The table is lazily initialized to a power-of-two size upon the first
# insertion. Each bin in the table normally contains a list of +Node+s (most
# often, the list has only zero or one +Node+). Table accesses require
# volatile/atomic reads, writes, and CASes. The lists of nodes within bins are
# always accurately traversable under volatile reads, so long as lookups check
# hash code and non-nullness of value before checking key equality.
#
# We use the top two bits of +Node+ hash fields for control purposes -- they
# are available anyway because of addressing constraints. As explained further
# below, these top bits are used as follows:
#
#   - 00 - Normal
#   - 01 - Locked
#   - 11 - Locked and may have a thread waiting for lock
#   - 10 - +Node+ is a forwarding node
#
# The lower 28 bits of each +Node+'s hash field contain a the key's hash code,
# except for forwarding nodes, for which the lower bits are zero (and so
# always have hash field == +MOVED+).
#
# Insertion (via +[]=+ or its variants) of the first node in an empty bin is
# performed by just CASing it to the bin. This is by far the most common case
# for put operations under most key/hash distributions. Other update
# operations (insert, delete, and replace) require locks. We do not want to
# waste the space required to associate a distinct lock object with each bin,
# so instead use the first node of a bin list itself as a lock. Blocking
# support for these locks relies +Util::CheapLockable. However, we also need a
# +try_lock+ construction, so we overlay these by using bits of the +Node+
# hash field for lock control (see above), and so normally use builtin
# monitors only for blocking and signalling using
# +cheap_wait+/+cheap_broadcast+ constructions. See +Node#try_await_lock+.
#
# Using the first node of a list as a lock does not by itself suffice though:
# When a node is locked, any update must first validate that it is still the
# first node after locking it, and retry if not. Because new nodes are always
# appended to lists, once a node is first in a bin, it remains first until
# deleted or the bin becomes invalidated (upon resizing). However, operations
# that only conditionally update may inspect nodes until the point of update.
# This is a converse of sorts to the lazy locking technique described by
# Herlihy & Shavit.
#
# The main disadvantage of per-bin locks is that other update operations on
# other nodes in a bin list protected by the same lock can stall, for example
# when user +eql?+ or mapping functions take a long time. However,
# statistically, under random hash codes, this is not a common problem.
# Ideally, the frequency of nodes in bins follows a Poisson distribution
# (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) with a parameter of
# about 0.5 on average, given the resizing threshold of 0.75, although with a
# large variance because of resizing granularity. Ignoring variance, the
# expected occurrences of list size k are (exp(-0.5) * pow(0.5, k) /
# factorial(k)). The first values are:
#
#   - 0:    0.60653066
#   - 1:    0.30326533
#   - 2:    0.07581633
#   - 3:    0.01263606
#   - 4:    0.00157952
#   - 5:    0.00015795
#   - 6:    0.00001316
#   - 7:    0.00000094
#   - 8:    0.00000006
#   - more: less than 1 in ten million
#
# Lock contention probability for two threads accessing distinct elements is
# roughly 1 / (8 * #elements) under random hashes.
#
# The table is resized when occupancy exceeds a percentage threshold
# (nominally, 0.75, but see below). Only a single thread performs the resize
# (using field +size_control+, to arrange exclusion), but the table otherwise
# remains usable for reads and updates. Resizing proceeds by transferring
# bins, one by one, from the table to the next table. Because we are using
# power-of-two expansion, the elements from each bin must either stay at same
# index, or move with a power of two offset. We eliminate unnecessary node
# creation by catching cases where old nodes can be reused because their next
# fields won't change. On average, only about one-sixth of them need cloning
# when a table doubles. The nodes they replace will be garbage collectable as
# soon as they are no longer referenced by any reader thread that may be in
# the midst of concurrently traversing table. Upon transfer, the old table bin
# contains only a special forwarding node (with hash field +MOVED+) that
# contains the next table as its key. On encountering a forwarding node,
# access and update operations restart, using the new table.
#
# Each bin transfer requires its bin lock. However, unlike other cases, a
# transfer can skip a bin if it fails to acquire its lock, and revisit it
# later. Method +rebuild+ maintains a buffer of TRANSFER_BUFFER_SIZE bins that
# have been skipped because of failure to acquire a lock, and blocks only if
# none are available (i.e., only very rarely). The transfer operation must
# also ensure that all accessible bins in both the old and new table are
# usable by any traversal. When there are no lock acquisition failures, this
# is arranged simply by proceeding from the last bin (+table.size - 1+) up
# towards the first. Upon seeing a forwarding node, traversals arrange to move
# to the new table without revisiting nodes. However, when any node is skipped
# during a transfer, all earlier table bins may have become visible, so are
# initialized with a reverse-forwarding node back to the old table until the
# new ones are established. (This sometimes requires transiently locking a
# forwarding node, which is possible under the above encoding.) These more
# expensive mechanics trigger only when necessary.
#
# The traversal scheme also applies to partial traversals of
# ranges of bins (via an alternate Traverser constructor)
# to support partitioned aggregate operations.  Also, read-only
# operations give up if ever forwarded to a null table, which
# provides support for shutdown-style clearing, which is also not
# currently implemented.
#
# Lazy table initialization minimizes footprint until first use.
#
# The element count is maintained using a +ThreadSafe::Util::Adder+,
# which avoids contention on updates but can encounter cache thrashing
# if read too frequently during concurrent access. To avoid reading so
# often, resizing is attempted either when a bin lock is
# contended, or upon adding to a bin already holding two or more
# nodes (checked before adding in the +x_if_absent+ methods, after
# adding in others). Under uniform hash distributions, the
# probability of this occurring at threshold is around 13%,
# meaning that only about 1 in 8 puts check threshold (and after
# resizing, many fewer do so). But this approximation has high
# variance for small table sizes, so we check on any collision
# for sizes <= 64. The bulk putAll operation further reduces
# contention by only committing count updates upon these size
# checks.

# Class holding common representation and mechanics for classes supporting
# dynamic striping on 64bit values.
#
# This class maintains a lazily-initialized table of atomically updated
# variables, plus an extra +base+ field. The table size is a power of two.
# Indexing uses masked per-thread hash codes. Nearly all methods on this
# class are private, accessed directly by subclasses.
#
# Table entries are of class +Cell+; a variant of AtomicLong padded to
# reduce cache contention on most processors. Padding is overkill for most
# Atomics because they are usually irregularly scattered in memory and thus
# don't interfere much with each other. But Atomic objects residing in
# arrays will tend to be placed adjacent to each other, and so will most
# often share cache lines (with a huge negative performance impact) without
# this precaution.
#
# In part because +Cell+s are relatively large, we avoid creating them until
# they are needed. When there is no contention, all updates are made to the
# +base+ field. Upon first contention (a failed CAS on +base+ update), the
# table is initialized to size 2. The table size is doubled upon further
# contention until reaching the nearest power of two greater than or equal
# to the number of CPUS. Table slots remain empty (+nil+) until they are
# needed.
#
# A single spinlock (+busy+) is used for initializing and resizing the
# table, as well as populating slots with new +Cell+s. There is no need for
# a blocking lock: When the lock is not available, threads try other slots
# (or the base). During these retries, there is increased contention and
# reduced locality, which is still better than alternatives.
#
# Per-thread hash codes are initialized to random values. Contention and/or
# table collisions are indicated by failed CASes when performing an update
# operation (see method +retry_update+). Upon a collision, if the table size
# is less than the capacity, it is doubled in size unless some other thread
# holds the lock. If a hashed slot is empty, and lock is available, a new
# +Cell+ is created. Otherwise, if the slot exists, a CAS is tried. Retries
# proceed by "double hashing", using a secondary hash (XorShift) to try to
# find a free slot.
#
# The table size is capped because, when there are more threads than CPUs,
# supposing that each thread were bound to a CPU, there would exist a
# perfect hash function mapping threads to slots that eliminates collisions.
# When we reach capacity, we search for this mapping by randomly varying the
# hash codes of colliding threads. Because search is random, and collisions
# only become known via CAS failures, convergence can be slow, and because
# threads are typically not bound to CPUS forever, may not occur at all.
# However, despite these limitations, observed contention rates are
# typically low in these cases.
#
# It is possible for a +Cell+ to become unused when threads that once hashed
# to it terminate, as well as in the case where doubling the table causes no
# thread to hash to it under expanded mask. We do not try to detect or
# remove such cells, under the assumption that for long-running instances,
# observed contention levels will recur, so the cells will eventually be
# needed again; and for short-lived ones, it does not matter.
