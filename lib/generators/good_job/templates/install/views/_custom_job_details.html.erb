Content added to this partial will be displayed above the argument list on the good_job/jobs#show page.

You can make use of the following variables:

- `job`: The `GoodJob::Job` instance. Calling `job.active_job` will deserialize an instance of your ActiveJob class.
- `main_app`: Use this to access helpers (e.g. route helpers) from your application.

Note: the `GoodJob::Job` class is considered an internal implementation detail and may change at any time. Please test your view extensions when upgrading.
