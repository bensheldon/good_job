module GoodJob
  #
  # ActiveJob Adapter.

  class Adapter
    # Valid execution modes.
    EXECUTION_MODES = [:async, :external, :inline].freeze

    # @param execution_mode [nil, Symbol] specifies how and where jobs should be executed. You can also set this with the environment variable +GOOD_JOB_EXECUTION_MODE+.
    #
    #  - +:inline+ executes jobs immediately in whatever process queued them (usually the web server process). This should only be used in test and development environments.
    #  - +:external+ causes the adapter to enqueue jobs, but not execute them. When using this option (the default for production environments), you'll need to use the command-line tool to actually execute your jobs.
    #  - +:async+ causes the adapter to execute you jobs in separate threads in whatever process queued them (usually the web process). This is akin to running the command-line tool's code inside your web server. It can be more economical for small workloads (you don't need a separate machine or environment for running your jobs), but if your web server is under heavy load or your jobs require a lot of resources, you should choose `:external` instead.
    #
    #  The default value depends on the Rails environment:
    #
    #  - +development+ and +test+: +:inline+
    #  - +production+ and all other environments: +:external+
    #
    # @param max_threads [nil, Integer] sets the number of threads per scheduler to use when +execution_mode+ is set to +:async+. The +queues+ parameter can specify a number of threads for each group of queues which will override this value. You can also set this with the environment variable +GOOD_JOB_MAX_THREADS+. Defaults to +5+.
    # @param queues [nil, String] determines which queues to execute jobs from when +execution_mode+ is set to +:async+. See {file:README.md#optimize-queues-threads-and-processes} for more details on the format of this string. You can also set this with the environment variable +GOOD_JOB_QUEUES+. Defaults to +"*"+.
    # @param poll_interval [nil, Integer] sets the number of seconds between polls for jobs when +execution_mode+ is set to +:async+. You can also set this with the environment variable +GOOD_JOB_POLL_INTERVAL+. Defaults to +1+.
