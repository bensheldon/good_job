  # Schedulers are generic thread pools that are responsible for
  # periodically checking for available tasks, executing tasks within a thread,
  # and efficiently scaling active threads.
  #
  # Every scheduler has a single {Performer} that will execute tasks.
  # The scheduler is responsible for calling its performer efficiently across threads managed by an instance of +Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor+.
  # If a performer does not have work, the thread will go to sleep.
  # The scheduler maintains an instance of +Concurrent::TimerTask+, which wakes sleeping threads and causes them to check whether the performer has new work.
