# GoodJob is a multithreaded, Postgres-based, ActiveJob backend for Ruby on Rails.
#
# +GoodJob+ is the top-level namespace and exposes configuration attributes.
module GoodJob
  # @!attribute [rw] active_record_parent_class
  #   @!scope class
  #   The ActiveRecord parent class inherited by +GoodJob::Execution+ (default: +ActiveRecord::Base+).
  #   Use this when using multiple databases or other custom ActiveRecord configuration.
  #   @return [ActiveRecord::Base]
  #   @example Change the base class:
  #     GoodJob.active_record_parent_class = "CustomApplicationRecord"
  mattr_accessor :active_record_parent_class, default: "ActiveRecord::Base"

  # @!attribute [rw] logger
  #   @!scope class
  #   The logger used by GoodJob (default: +Rails.logger+).
  #   Use this to redirect logs to a special location or file.
  #   @return [Logger, nil]
  #   @example Output GoodJob logs to a file:
  #     GoodJob.logger = ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging.new(ActiveSupport::Logger.new("log/my_logs.log"))
  mattr_accessor :logger, default: ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging.new(ActiveSupport::Logger.new($stdout))

  # @!attribute [rw] preserve_job_records
  #   @!scope class
  #   Whether to preserve job records in the database after they have finished (default: +false+).
  #   By default, GoodJob deletes job records after the job is completed successfully.
  #   If you want to preserve jobs for latter inspection, set this to +true+.
  #   If you want to preserve only jobs that finished with error for latter inspection, set this to +:on_unhandled_error+.
  #   If +true+, you will need to clean out jobs using the +good_job cleanup_preserved_jobs+ CLI command or
  #   by using +Goodjob.cleanup_preserved_jobs+.
  #   @return [Boolean, nil]
  mattr_accessor :preserve_job_records, default: false

  # @!attribute [rw] retry_on_unhandled_error
  #   @!scope class
  #   Whether to re-perform a job when a type of +StandardError+ is raised to GoodJob (default: +true+).
  #   If +true+, causes jobs to be re-queued and retried if they raise an instance of +StandardError+.
  #   If +false+, jobs will be discarded or marked as finished if they raise an instance of +StandardError+.
  #   Instances of +Exception+, like +SIGINT+, will *always* be retried, regardless of this attribute's value.
  #   @return [Boolean, nil]
  mattr_accessor :retry_on_unhandled_error, default: true

  # @!attribute [rw] on_thread_error
  #   @!scope class
  #   This callable will be called when an exception reaches GoodJob (default: +nil+).
  #   It can be useful for logging errors to bug tracking services, like Sentry or Airbrake.
  #   @example Send errors to Sentry
  #     # config/initializers/good_job.rb
  #     GoodJob.on_thread_error = -> (exception) { Raven.capture_exception(exception) }
  #   @return [Proc, nil]

  # Stop executing jobs.
  # GoodJob does its work in pools of background threads.
  # When forking processes you should shut down these background threads before forking, and restart them after forking.
  # For example, you should use +shutdown+ and +restart+ when using async execution mode with Puma.
  # See the {file:README.md#executing-jobs-async--in-process} for more explanation and examples.
  # @param timeout [nil, Numeric] Seconds to wait for actively executing jobs to finish
  #   * +nil+, the scheduler will trigger a shutdown but not wait for it to complete.
  #   * +-1+, the scheduler will wait until the shutdown is complete.
  #   * +0+, the scheduler will immediately shutdown and stop any active tasks.
