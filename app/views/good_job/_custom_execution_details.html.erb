Content added to this partial will be displayed above the collapsible JSON representation of each execution on the jobs#show view.

You can make use of the following variables:

- `job`: The `GoodJob::Job` instance.
- `execution`: The `GoodJob::DiscreteExecution` instance.
- `main_app`: Use this to access helpers (e.g. route helpers) from your application.

Note: the `GoodJob::Job` and `GoodJob::Execution` classes are considered an internal implementation detail of GoodJob and may change at any time. Please test your view extensions when upgrading.
